Virture 360
Rails app for viewing 360 music videos or concerts

Project Goals
I want to create a web app for viewing concerts in live stream from any device. Preferebly a VR headset for the full immersion experience. At the moment, I have not paid for a server to run live stream, so as a demo, 360 videos are pulled from youtube. You must sign in to have access to viewership, as it is designed to be a paid service in the future.
